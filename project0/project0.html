    <h1>Notes for Lesson 1</h1>

    <b>World Wide Web</b>
    <p>The World Wide Web is mainly composed of <b>HTML</b> documents. HTML represents
      <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, which is used by the browers to parse the
      webpage. The major pieces of the World Wide Web include <b>clients</b>,
      <b>Internet</b> and <b>servers</b>. And a client interacts with servers with <b>HTTP</b>.
    </p>

    <b>HTML Elements</b>
    <p>HTML Elements are used to indicate how the browers will show the contents
      in the webpage.
    </p>
    <p>Most of HTML Elements are composed of <b>openning tag</b>, <b>closing tag</b>,
      and <b>contents</b> between them.
    </p>
    <p>&ltb&gttext&lt/b&gt makes the contents <b>Bold</b><br>
      &ltem&gttext&lt/em&gt makes the contents <em>Italic</em><br>
      ps: how to show &lt and &gt are learned from
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_entities.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/HTML/html_entities.asp</a>
    </p>

    <b>HTML Attribute</b>
    <p>Some elements contain attributes in the opening tag, which is used to provide
      extra information for the browser. For example, the anchor tag uses a href attribute
      to define the URL to link.<br>
      &lta href="url"&gtlink&lt/a&gt establishes a hyperlink, whose attribute href is
      url and name is link.<br>
      &ltimg src="url" alt="text"&gt shows an image whose address is url. If the
      image cannot be shown, then "text" will be shown.
    </p>

      &ltbr&gt is a void element and is used to switch to a new line.<br>
